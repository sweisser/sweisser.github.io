# Privacy Policy for SimpleGPS

## Introduction

This is the privacy policy for the Android App "SimpleGPS", developed by me (Stefan Weisser) and published on the Google Play store.
This app is provided free of charge and is a personal hobby project.

## Data Use and Storage

SimpleGPS uses Location Permissions to provide detailed GPS location for the user.
Data about Waypoints is stored on the device, if the user uses this functionality. The data will not be encrypted.
That data is never transmitted by the app to any other servers.
The waypoint data will remain in the database until the user removes that waypoint or until the app is deleted.

## User Control and Choices

Since the purpose of this app is to show GPS information, the app will not work without these permissions.

## Third-Party Libraries

SimpleGPS uses Androids Location API.

## Changes to this Policy

This privacy policy can change anytime without notice.
