# Privacy Policy for SimpleGPS

## Introduction

This is the privacy policy for the Android App "SimpleGPS", developed by me (Stefan Weisser) and published on the Google Play store.
This app is provided free of charge and is a personal hobby project.

    Briefly describe your app, its purpose, and the developer/company behind it.
    State that your app does not collect any personal data directly from users.
    Briefly mention that it requires location permissions and why they are necessary for the app's functionality.

## Information Collected


    Specify that the app uses the device's built-in GPS function to access location data.
    Mention the type of location data collected (GPS coordinates, cell tower information, Wi-Fi data, etc.).
    Clarify that this data is only used for app functionality and remains stored on the device itself.
    Emphasize that no location data is ever transmitted off the device or shared with any third parties.

## Data Use and Storage

SimpleGPS uses Location Permissions to provide detailed GPS location for the user.
Data about Waypoints is stored on the device, if the user uses this functionality. The data will not be encrypted.
That data is never transmitted by the app to any other servers.
The waypoint data will remain in the database until the user removes that waypoint or until the app is deleted.

## User Control and Choices

Since the purpose of this app is to show GPS information, the app will not work without these permissions.

## Third-Party Libraries

SimpleGPS uses Androids Location API.

## Changes to this Policy

This privacy policy can change anytime without notice.
